Zero Waste India (ZWI) is a non-profit organization, dedicated to ending our age of wastefulness through improved industrial design & education for the 21 century.
Zero Waste India operates nationally to bring forward policies amongst individuals, organizations and communities, with the objective of supporting the continuous reuse of resources on the front-end and simultaneously advocating for the elimination of landfills and waste-to-energy (incineration) on the back-end.
We also advocate at all levels of government for responsible resource management and policies, legislation and initiatives that eliminate waste.
Part of Zero Waste India’s role is to provide the public with clarity over the concept of Zero Waste.
Zero Waste India provides a Zero Waste Certification program for organizations across all sectors to implement these internationally accepted policies and practices, in so doing providing the public with a clear understanding of what is meant by a Zero Waste policy.
In addition, Zero Waste India offers educational outreach programs for Zero Waste including specific guides, technical knowledge and a variety of educational materials.
We are continuing to grow alongside the global Zero Waste community with Zero Waste chapters and membership across the nation.
Zero Waste is all about collaboration and inclusivity. We therefore invite everyone to join! Whether you are an individual or an organization (public or private, for-profit or not-for-profit), we invite you to become a member and work with us to collectively edge closer and closer to a Zero Waste society.
